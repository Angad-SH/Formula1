# Formula1
Visualisation for Seasons 1950-2022. The project's main objective is to make Formula 1 race data more accessible and engaging for fans, researchers, and enthusiasts, enabling them to explore historical race results, analyse driver performance, and gain insights into the sport's speed dynamics on different tracks over the years.

Formula 1, or F1, is a motorsport defined by open wheeled single seated race cars. It features the best drivers in the most powerful and technically advanced cars. The sport is governed by the FIA (Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile). Here, 10 teams comprising of 2 drivers each compete in a series of races over a period of 1 year to find the ultimate driver and constructor champion. 
This Formula 1 Python Program is a versatile tool for Formula 1 enthusiasts and researchers. It provides an interactive interface for exploring and analysing Formula 1 race data from 1950 to 2022. Powered by Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this program offers multiple functionalities. 
Users can interact with the program to achieve several objectives: 
1. Retrieve Detailed Race Results: By specifying the year and the name of a Grand Prix event, users can access comprehensive race results, including driver and constructor information, grid positions, finishing positions, points earned, lap times, and more. This feature offers a deep dive into the details of any Formula 1 race within the specified time frame. 
2. Explore All-Time Grand Prix Winners: The program showcases all Formula 1 Grand Prix winners, presenting a visual representation of the most successful drivers in the history of the sport. Users can gain insights into the legends who have conquered the most races. 
3. Analyse Top 'n' Grand Prix Winners: Users can select a number 'n' to view a bar chart highlighting the top 'n' drivers with the most Grand Prix wins. This feature allows users to focus on the most dominant drivers in Formula 1 history. 
4. Visualize Speed Dynamics Over the Years: The program provides a captivating visualization of average fastest lap speeds recorded on various tracks from the year 2004 onwards. This facetgrid plot offers a comparative view of speed dynamics at different Grand Prix events, adding an extra layer of understanding to the sport's evolution. 
5. List all the winners of a particular year: Users can enter a year and we can show a list of all the winners for that particular year. 
6. List the last 20 wins of a driver: Users can enter the name of a driver and we can show a list of the last 20 wins for the particular driver.

The primary objective of this mini project is to make Formula 1 race data accessible and engaging for fans and researchers alike. Whether users seek historical race results, wish to analyse driver performance, or are interested in the speed dynamics on Formula 1 tracks over the years, this program delivers an interactive and informative experience, offering a deeper appreciation of the world of Formula 1 racing.
